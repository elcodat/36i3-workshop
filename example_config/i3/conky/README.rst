unicode chars
-------------
Copied unicode symbols from [1].

  vim: enter with i, CTRL-v, u<hex>, such as uf240 for
  fa-battery-full

"black" symbols are displayed as white if we have black bg, apparently. All
symbols from fontawesome.com have names such as fa-battery-full. In
conkyrc.lua, the symbols are arguments to ``*entry()`` functions::

   parts.brightness = hh.sep_entry('ïƒ«', nil, "${exec " .. brightness_command .. "}")
